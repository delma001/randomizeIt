Author: Robert delMas
Maintainer: delma001@umn.edu
Description:     This package provides a shiny app that implements methods to estimate bootstrap confidence intervals and estimate p-values using randomiztion methods.
    Contexts that can be modeled are: 
    (1) one-sample situations where there is a single categorical or quantitative response variable
    (2) two-sample situations with either a categorical or quantitative response variable and a categorical explanatory variable that identifies only two groups.
    Controls are provided for importing data files in CSV format.
